## Analysis Summary
The exploratory data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, focusing on usage patterns such as ride duration, rider type, and temporal trends.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full Excel workbook containing cleaned data, calculations, and pivot tables is referenced within the documentation rather than stored directly in the repository.

The complete findings, visualizations, and business recommendations are presented in detail in the PowerPoint file located in the `presentation/` folder.
